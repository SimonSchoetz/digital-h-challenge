### Issues I ran into

- Forms kinda torn apart with text passages between them, and buttons forced to be on the bottom. (Always feels odd to break out of the element's "natural" placing behavior for responsive reasons)
- Buttons inside the form trigger the submit event every time -> would it be a better practice to use buttons outside the form and bypass the submit event entirely?
- Why are there 2 back buttons all the time? Does it make sense?
