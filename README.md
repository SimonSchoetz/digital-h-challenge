# Digital H Challenge

 Coding challenge to demonstrate my capabilities.

---
I built this demo by keeping an actual usage in mind, so it doesn't just 'look' like it is doing what it is doing but the logic should make it possible to implement form validation and further backend processing.

## Technologies: 
- React.js
- SCSS

### Issues I ran into

- Forms kinda torn apart with text passages between them, and buttons forced to be on the bottom. (Always feels odd to break out of the element's "natural" placing behavior for responsive reasons)
- Buttons inside the form trigger the submit event every time -> would it be a better practice to use buttons outside the form and bypass the submit event entirely?
- Why are there 2 back buttons all the time? Does it make sense?
